#Introduction

The World Bank Group has set two goals for the world to achieve by 2030:

End extreme poverty by decreasing the percentage of people living on less than $1.90 a day to no more than 3%

Promote shared prosperity by fostering the income growth of the bottom 40% for every country

The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. The World Bank Group comprises five institutions managed by their member countries.
Established in 1944, the World Bank Group is headquartered in Washington, D.C. We have more than 10,000 employees
in more than 120 offices worldwide.

The World Bank also provides free and open access to global development data that it collects on their website
at data.worldbank.org.  This analysis will utilize this data to provide insight into countries of various GDP
levels and the income levels of the people who live in those countries.  

We are utilizing the following queried data sets in our analysis:
Education Statistics - The World Bank EdStats All Indicator Query
GDP Ranking - Gross domestic product ranking table

names(GDP) <- c("CountryCode","Ranking","Economy","MUSD")  #Names for Columns

GDPFinal <- subset(x=GDPFinal, Ranking >0) #Removes Outliers Items with no MUSD or that are not countries


urladdress <-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FEDSTATS_Country.csv"
EDU <- source_data(urladdress, sep=",", header=TRUE)
```
#Merge of Datasets GDPFinal and EDU
```{r}
GDPEDUdata <- merge(x=GDPFinal, y=EDU, by = "CountryCode", all=TRUE) #Merge of data by CountryCode
```
##Question 1
#Merge the data based on the country shortcode. How many of the IDs match?
#Based on the Merge of the Country Education Data and the Gross Domestic Product Data, there were 190 matches
#for countries that had GDP data available and that had Education Data entered.
```{r}
GDPEDUdataRank <- subset(x=GDPEDUdata, Ranking > 0) #Remove non matched data
GDPEDUdataRank <- dplyr::arrange(GDPEDUdataRank, Ranking)
GDPEDUdataRank[c(1:2)]
```
##Question 2
#Sort the data frame in ascending order by GDP (so United States is last). What is the 13th
#country in the resulting data frame?
```{r}
GDPEDUdataRank$MUSD<-as.numeric(gsub("\\,","",GDPEDUdataRank$MUSD)) #remove commas and change to numeric
GDPEDUdataRank$MUSD<-as.numeric(gsub("\\$","",GDPEDUdataRank$MUSD)) #remove Dollar signs and change to numeric
GDPEDUdataRank$Ranking<-as.numeric(GDPEDUdataRank$Ranking) #convert Rankings to Numeric
GDPEDUdataRank <- dplyr::arrange(GDPEDUdataRank, MUSD) #
GDPEDUdataRank[c(1:2)]
```

#KNA is the Thirteenth country on the list.

##Question 3
#What are the average GDP rankings for the "High income: OECD" and "High income:nonOECD" groups?
```{r}
HighIncomeOECD <- subset(GDPEDUdataRank, `Income Group` == "High income: OECD")
HighIncomeOECD$Ranking<-as.numeric(HighIncomeOECD$Ranking) #convert Rankings to Numeric
HighIncomeOECD[c(1,6)] #CheckValues in Income Group Column
summary(HighIncomeOECD)
```
#Average Ranking is 32.97
```{r}
HighIncomenonOECD <- subset(GDPEDUdataRank, `Income Group` == "High income: nonOECD")
HighIncomenonOECD$Ranking<-as.numeric(HighIncomenonOECD$Ranking) #convert Rankings to Numeric
HighIncomenonOECD[c(1,6)] #CheckValues in Income Group Column
summary(HighIncomenonOECD)
```
#Average Ranking is 91.91

##Question 4
#Plot the GDP for all of the countries. Use ggplot2 to color your plot by Income Group.
#g<-g+ggtitle("GDP")
#g+theme(plot.title = element_text(size=20, face="bold", vjust=1, lineheight=0.6))
#g+theme(legend.title = element_text(colour="chocolate", size=16, face="bold"))
```{r}
g<-ggplot(GDPEDUdataRank, aes(Ranking, MUSD, color=factor(`Income Group`)))+geom_point()
g
```

##Question 5
#Cut the GDP ranking into 5 separate quantile groups. Make a table versus Income.Group.
#How many countries are Lower middle income but among the 38 nations with highest
#GDP?

##Additional Info - Exploration
#quantile(GDPEDUdataRank$MUSD)
#brks <- with(GDPEDUdataRank, quantile(MUSD, probs = c(0, 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.8, 1)))
#GDPEDUdataRankQant <- within(GDPEDUdataRank, quantile <- cut(MUSD, breaks = brks, labels = 1:5, include.lowest = TRUE))
```{r}
brks2 <- with(GDPEDUdataRank, quantile(Ranking, probs = c(0, 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.8, 1)))
GDPEDUdataRankQantRnk <- within(GDPEDUdataRank, quantile <- cut(Ranking, breaks = brks2, labels = 1:5, include.lowest = TRUE))
```
#Table
```{r}
table(GDPEDUdataRankQantRnk$quantile, GDPEDUdataRankQantRnk$`Income Group`, exclude = NULL)
```

#Separating out the Lower middle income group for comparison to ranking of Top 38 GDP Countries
#was not able to get Rmarkdown to process the code below: code produces list of five countries below.
#```{r}
#LowerMiddleIncome <- subset(GDPEDUdataRankQant, `Income Group` == "Lower middle income") #create subset for Lower Middle Income
#LowerMiddleIncomeTop38GDP <- subset(LowerMiddleIncome, Ranking <= 38) #create additional subset with top 38 GDPs
#LowerMiddleIncomeTop38GDP[c(1:2)] #list of GDPs with both that are both in the lower Middle income group and in top 38 GDPs
#```
#Five countries are in the lower middle income group that are in the top 38 GDP.
#CHN (2)
#IND (10)
#IDN (16)
#THA (31)
#EGY (38)
